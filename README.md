# Git Basics
Git is not a completely new tool for me. I have been using it for some time now and I realize how valuable it is. Even more. It's hard for me to imagine development without version control.
In my previous acquaintance, there were significant gaps. I understood how this tool worked, but I used it very sparingly, as there was no need for more.
And as it turned out, Git is much more functional, flexible and thoughtful than I imagined. Especially as a command tool.

Linux commands were not new to me. Some I did not know, but did not use. I plan to use it in the future.
It is also interesting to learn a lot about the HTTP protocol. I already knew something, but I refreshed my memory. I understand one thing that it is simply not possible to remember everything at once.
